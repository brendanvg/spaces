How do I access browserify bundled functions from html?
  -click on a button (inside a popup) and run a function in bundle.js

WHAT I want to do:  click on the map, add a label,  submitBut -> submitBut callls addMarker

=add event listener inside bundle.js -> doesn't recognize the getElementByID call..... 
  - window.addMarker = addMArker -> can't find it when call addMarker from html
  -when onclick event is put in popup, and it is asked to call function, if the function exists in bundle.js, it says it is not defined

--browserify entry.js --s -o public/bundle.js -> make the module global


scp to server....
